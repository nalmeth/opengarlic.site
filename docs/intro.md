# Introduction

## What is this?

> This is a platform for social drawing games on a webpage.
> The standard game mode is based on the children's game: [Telephone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_whispers).
> However, different game modes can be developed to plugin.

## What's with the name?

> This project's name comes from two things. The common use of 'Open' in
> open source software, particularly when a variation of another piece of software.
> Garlic, because it's a malapropism of a similar game.

## Why?

> Development of this was partly a project to learn some new things.
> The other part is, I find this game genuinely fun to play. I wanted to
> open source the game for others to contribute and be able to run
> their own servers.

## How can I contribute?

> Feel free to look through the issues and see if anything interests you.
> You can also develop new game modes and share with others.
>
> [Read the docs](Tutorial/creatingagame) on how to get started.
